## Projects
- Review projects discussed last week ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQlnirk1vBnks1vbu__OWR-zazp7rfZFNGHuqthE8co/edit#gid=0))
    + any additional thoughts or projects?
    + need to take some time to talk amongst yourselves?
- Decide on a project and add your name to the document under "participants"
    + Create a project tracking document 
        * a Google Spreadsheet works well and is easy to make
        * or if you wanted to get fancy, you could try a project tracking website like [Trello](https://trello.com/b/qflW402J/test) or [Asana](https://asana.com/)
        * or if you like github, you could create a repository for your project and keep track of everything using the wiki, issues, and README.
        * whatever you choose, share access with me
        * if in a group, have one or two people agree to **take notes** for the rest of the planning session
    + start talking about (**and recording!**) what you want to include in the project
      + Start big and try to break down each big chunk (business requirements) into smaller pieces (functional requirements). These can and will be somewhat arbitrary, but the process of thinking about what needs to get done is helpful in itself). For more on this process, see [this article](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/functional-requirements-vs-business-requirements-65938.html). Or think of it as establishing goals and then defining discrete tasks that will help you achieve that goal.
      + What data do you need? (again, **record** it as you discuss it)                           
    + If in a group, start talking about **who wants to do what**
        * Doesn't necessarily need to be about each person doing what they have the most experience with, although that can help.
        * If a team member is excited about working on some aspect of the project, they should definitely be involved with that aspect!

## For next time (for group *and* individual projects)
- Assemble a list of data that you will need to acquire
- Have a rough draft of a set of goals, tasks, and roles for your project.
